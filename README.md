Fluo is a Unity visualizer that mixes [StableFluids] and [spectral.js] to
produce fluid, spectrum-driven graphics.

An iPhone acts as both the camera and the remote controller. It streams to a
macOS or Windows host over [NDI], and the host renders the final composition.

[StableFluids]: https://github.com/keijiro/StableFluids
[spectral.js]: https://github.com/keijiro/spectral.js-unity
